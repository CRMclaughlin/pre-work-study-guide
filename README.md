 # Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

- I wanted to create a webpage for prework study guide

- I built this project to help learn more about coding and be setup for success in the bootcamp

- This page helps organize some of the topics we learned through prework assignments

- I learned how to operate on a terminal. How to access and setup files through terminal. How to access my git repo, How to debug certain issues (not sure I'll remember them all) and mostly that google is my friend and I don't have to try and solve every problem, there is a lot of help out there!
